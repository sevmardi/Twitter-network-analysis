Data
To compute the top 20 the following measurements were used.: 
betweennesscentrality,

closeness centrality which is is somewhat related to 

degree centrality which is the degree of a node. For instance we use the out degree of a node for this. We then sort the nodes in descending order. We define it as $DC(u) = \max(\forall v \in V : k^\rightarrow(v))$.


I applied the above measurements to the small dataset
