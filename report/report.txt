3.1 Parsing the tweets
--------------------




3.2 Dataset statistics
-------------------
Continuing with the tweet parser I have build in the previous example. 






3.3 Top Twitter users
----------------
To compute the top 20 the following measurements were used.: 
betweennesscentrality,

closeness centrality which is is somewhat related to 

degree centrality which is the degree of a node. For instance we use the out degree of a node for this. We then sort the nodes in descending order. We define it as $DC(u) = \max(\forall v \in V : k^\rightarrow(v))$.

I applied the above measurements to the small dataset 




3.5 Visualisation
--------------
This was one of the challenging ones. Using Gephi is honeslty not my strongest skills. I struggeld, and I struggeld alot. 



3.6 larger dataset
------------------
% Since we use our own parser (see appendices) we can quite easily run the statistics on the \texttt{twitter-larger} dataset. The results are incorporated in \autoref{tab:dataset-stats}, \autoref{fig:degree-distributions}, and \autoref{fig:distance-distributions}. Furthermore, we can compute the eccentricity for every node exactly using the algorithm by F.W. Takes et al. and arrive at the eccentricity for each node in approximately 17,000 breadth first searches. This is about 20 times faster than the naive approach.

% The closeness centrality is a bit more challenging to compute. Instead, we approximate it by sampling the distance between 10,000 randomly selected nodes and everything else, and averaging those results.\footnote{While this method is a lot of work, it is doable in about an hour, while doing the entire computation would take slightly over a day.} As a slight bonus, calculating the eccentricities also gives us the diameter of the network, which is shown in \autoref{tab:dataset-stats}. What is interesting, is that the diameter of \texttt{twitter-larger} is only slightly greater than the diameter of \texttt{twitter-small}, despite the former being about ten times smaller than the latter. This is a property often observed in social networks.
